# CS211-Project-3
Fall 2023, CS211.
Third project for the course.
The project is an evil "hangman" game where if given the opportunity, the program would make it as difficult as possible to give the answer from a variety of words. Through comparing multiple words from a dictionary and identifying what has the most varied choices, the program attempts to show as little progress as the participant can possibly do.
